## CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
None.


## FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates generally to blockchain analytics and risk assessment systems, and more particularly to methods and systems for evaluating cryptocurrency wallet risk using composite entropy analysis, Bayesian inference networks, and graph-based risk propagation algorithms.


## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION


### Problem Statement
The proliferation of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption has created significant challenges for financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and service providers in assessing the risk associated with blockchain addresses. Current solutions suffer from:


1. **Static Analysis Limitations**: Existing tools rely on simple blacklists or rule-based systems that fail to adapt to evolving threat patterns
2. **Lack of Behavioral Analysis**: Current methods do not quantify the randomness or predictability of wallet behavior
3. **Limited Network Effects**: Failure to account for risk propagation through transaction networks
4. **Poor Real-time Capabilities**: Inability to provide dynamic risk assessment as behavior patterns change


### Prior Art Deficiencies
- US Patent 10,255,342 (Chainalysis): Limited to static clustering algorithms
- US Patent 11,093,485 (Elliptic): Focuses on labeled data without behavioral entropy
- Academic papers on blockchain analysis lack production-ready implementations combining multiple risk factors


## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION


The present invention provides a comprehensive system and method for assessing blockchain wallet risk through:


1. **Multi-dimensional Entropy Analysis**: Quantifying behavioral randomness across temporal, value, protocol, and gas dimensions using Shannon entropy with Lyapunov stability checking
2. **Adaptive Bayesian Risk Networks**: Dynamic inference of risk levels based on wallet age and funding sources with online learning capabilities
3. **Graph-based Risk Propagation**: N-hop adjacency analysis with exponential decay factors for network effect calculation
4. **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**: Autoencoder-based detection of unusual patterns with dynamic threshold adjustment

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION


### System Architecture


The invention comprises three primary analytical modules operating in parallel:


#### 1. Entropy Analysis Module (100)


The system calculates behavioral entropy using the Shannon entropy formula:


```
H(X) = -Σ p(xi) * log2(p(xi))
```


Applied across four dimensions:


a) **Temporal Entropy (110)**:
   - Analyzes inter-transaction time intervals
   - Uses logarithmic binning for interval distribution
   - Formula: H_temporal = -Σ p(interval_i) * log2(p(interval_i))


b) **Value Entropy (120)**:
   - Measures transaction amount diversity
   - Implements IQR-based outlier removal
   - Creates logarithmic bins for value distribution


c) **Protocol Interaction Entropy (130)**:
   - Quantifies diversity of smart contract interactions
   - Maps protocol addresses to known entities


d) **Gas Price Entropy (140)**:
   - Detects bot vs. human behavior patterns
   - Uses linear binning for gas price distribution


#### 2. Lyapunov Stability Analysis (200)


The system implements novel stability checking:


```
λ = lim(t→∞) (1/t) * ln(|δZ(t)|/|δZ(0)|)
```


Where:
- λ = Lyapunov exponent
- δZ(t) = divergence at time t
- Classification: λ < 0.1 (stable), 0.1 ≤ λ < 0.5 (unstable), λ ≥ 0.5 (chaotic)


#### 3. Adjacency Graph Risk Propagation (300)


Implements a novel risk propagation algorithm:


```
Risk(node_i) = LocalRisk(node_i) + Σ(Risk(node_j) * DecayFactor^distance)
```


Where:
- DecayFactor = 0.5 (configurable)
- distance = shortest path length
- Maximum propagation depth = 3 hops


#### 4. Bayesian Risk Network (400)


Utilizes a three-node Bayesian network:


```
P(Risk|Age,Source) = P(Risk,Age,Source) / P(Age,Source)
```


With conditional probability tables updated through online learning:


```
CPT_new = (Count + α) / (Total + α * |States|)
```


Where α = Laplace smoothing parameter


### Novel Aspects


1. **Composite Risk Scoring (500)**:
   ```
   FinalScore = w1*BayesianRisk + w2*AdjacencyRisk + w3*EntropyScore
   ```
   With adaptive weight adjustment based on confidence levels


2. **Real-time Monitoring Integration (600)**:
   - WebSocket connections for live transaction monitoring
   - Dynamic risk score updates with sub-second latency


3. **Machine Learning Enhancement (700)**:
   - Autoencoder architecture for anomaly detection
   - Online learning with sliding window approach

## ABSTRACT


A system and method for assessing blockchain wallet risk through multi-dimensional behavioral analysis. The invention combines Shannon entropy calculations across temporal, value, protocol, and gas dimensions with Lyapunov stability analysis to quantify behavioral predictability. A Bayesian inference network determines risk probabilities based on wallet characteristics, while a graph-based algorithm propagates risk scores through transaction networks. Machine learning enhancement through autoencoders enables anomaly detection. The system provides real-time risk scoring with applications in regulatory compliance, fraud prevention, and institutional risk management. The composite scoring mechanism adapts weights based on confidence levels, providing robust risk assessment across diverse blockchain ecosystems.
